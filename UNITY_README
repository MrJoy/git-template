The Unity templates included here add support for showing metadata diffs in much
the same was as the Asset Server interface.  This is achieved by using the 
binary2text program included with Unity, and installing it as a "text converter"
in Git.  A "text converter" is used for showing diffs of binary files in a 
meaningful way, but where such tool cannot be used to actually perform *merges* 
of binary files.

The bin/ directory includes a simple wrapper script around binary2text to make 
it behave in the way Git expects.

You'll want to add the following to ~/.gitconfig in order to fully take 
advantage of the Unity templates:

[diff "unity"]
      textconv=unity2text

After that, you will want to ensure that the binary2text program included with 
Unity -- and the git-template bin directory are both in your path.

On Mac, the binary2text program can be found in:

  /Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/Tools/

Or, for iPhone users:

  /Applications/Unity iPhone/Unity.app/Contents/Tools/

(Be sure to escape the space with a \ when adding it to your path!)

Assuming you checked out git-template to a directory under your home directory
named "Tools", adding the requisite items to your path can be achieved by 
editing the file named ".profile" in your home directory and adding a line like 
this:

  export PATH=$PATH:~/Tools/git-template/bin:/Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/Tools

Modify as needed based on where Unity and git-template are installed.
