h1. OVERVIEW

git-template is a tool to provide a somewhat broader templating functionality 
than the one provided with git itself.

Git templates only relate to files in the .git directory, but git-template 
templates can include files throughout the working set.

Additionally, git-template provides some out-of-the-box templates, of particular
note, ones relevant to Unity3D users.


h1. REQUIREMENTS

* A Unix-like environment, particularly including Bash.
* Perl
* Rsync

Note that this was developed/tested under MacOS X, which should work fine 
out-of-the-box.


h1. USAGE

bq. cd /path/to/your/git/repo
git template SomeTemplateName

bq. ...

bq. git template --freshen


h1. LICENSE

Dual licensed under the terms of the MIT X11 or GNU GPL.


h1. TODO

* More rigorous testing of symlink use-cases.
* Ability to specify removal of files (example: existing hook files in hooks directory, for Unity_Desktop template...).
* Add git-cleanup script, run it whenever a .gitignore is adjusted.
* Way to specify some things, such as .gitignore in terms of lines that must/must not be present.
* Less awkward project structure.
* Actual test-suite.
* Installation instructions.
